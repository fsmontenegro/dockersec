### Microservices?

### Microservices
<small>
*"Many development teams have found the microservices architectural style to be a superior approach to a monolithic architecture. But other teams have found them to be a productivity-sapping burden. Like any architectural style, microservices bring costs and benefits. To make a sensible choice you have to understand these and apply them to your specific context.""*

Martin Fowler ( http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-trade-offs.html)

### Significant benefits
* Support CI/CD practices
* Easier to achieve scale
* Operational benefits of "DevOps"



### DataDog Container Survey

(https://www.datadoghq.com/docker-adoption/)

Two schools of thought:
* Containers as up&down microservices
* Containers as "lightweight servers" that stay up
