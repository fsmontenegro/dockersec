## Looking at the Future

* Unikernels
  + one degree further
  + compile kernel for application
  + potentially bad idea?

* Serverless Architecture
  + AWS Lambda
  + Microsoft Batch Services



## Wrapping up

* Docker Security "Anti-Patterns"
  + free-for-all (unrestricted containers in Prod)
  + treating containers as servers

* Recommendations for Security
  + **Don't try to stop it!!!**
  + no agents on containers
  + watch for outbound traffic
  + keep up to date (news!)
